Hey there!
This repo has all the OS Lab experiments — perfect if you're trying to get a grip on Linux commands, shell scripting, file handling, and process management. It’s basically a hands-on guide to learning the core stuff we study in Operating Systems.

What’s Inside?
You'll find experiments related to:

Basic Linux commands

Working with files and directories

Shell scripting (loops, conditionals, etc.)

File permissions & using the vi editor

System calls like read(), write(), and fork()

Orphan & Zombie processes

Threads in Linux

Makefile for compiling C/C++ projects
